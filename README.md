Houses my console and its compatible apps.

Note: Make sure that all the files that you download from here are in the same folder so that they'll work properly. Also, don't change the file names, since this will prevent apps from working. Also, you will need the checklist source program in order for the Checklist app to function properly.

This is a console that I decided to develop for a personal project - just for fun. It should be pretty useful in terms of data analysis or just everyday use.
