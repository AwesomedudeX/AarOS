# AarOS
Houses my console and its compatible apps.

This is a console that I decided to develop for a fun personal project. It should be pretty helpful in terms of data analysis or just everyday use.

Also, don't forget to turn on notifications so you know when I'm making updates to apps or releasing new ones. Hope you find this console useful!

### App Usage Notes:

 - Make sure that you download the checklist source and settings source programs with the console whether you are using them or not, as the console may not work properly without them.
 - Make sure that all the files that you download from here are in the same folder so that they'll work properly. Also, don't change the file names, since this will prevent apps from working.
 - Make sure not to tamper with any of the code unless you know what you're doing. This may affect the functionality of the programs, though there isn't much risk that comes with this other than messing up the source programs, which is specific to your device. Other than that, if you accidentally mess up an app, don't be afraid to just delete it and redownload it from this page.
 - The Checklist app will need the checklist source program to function properly, so don't forget to download that if you're downloading the Checklist app. It currently requires an IDE to save changes, so don't use it unless you're fine with running the AarOS on an IDE.
 - The Settings app will need the settings source program to function properly, so don't forget to download that if you're going to download the Settings app. Like the Checklist app, it currently requires an IDE to save changes, so don't use it unless you're fine with running the AarOS on an IDE.
 - Don't run any of the apps, as they will not do anything. However, if you run the Checklist app, it will reset, so do not do this unless you want a quick way to reset it.
