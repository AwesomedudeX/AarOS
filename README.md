# AarOS
Houses my console and its compatible apps.

This is a console that I decided to develop for a fun personal project. It should be pretty helpful in terms of data analysis or just everyday use.

Also, don't forget to read the app usage notes if this is your first time using the console, and turn on notifications so you know when I'm making updates to apps or releasing new ones, and if you run into any problems, feel free to tell me in the Discussions section. Hope you find this console useful!

### App Usage Notes:

 - Make sure that you download the checklist source and settings source programs with the console whether you are using them or not, as the console may not work properly without them.
 - Make sure that all the files that you download from here are in the same folder so that they'll work properly. Also, don't change the file names, since this will prevent apps from working.
 - Make sure not to tamper with any of the code unless you know what you're doing. This may affect the functionality of the programs, though there isn't much risk that comes with this other than messing up the source programs, which is specific to your device. Other than that, if you accidentally mess up an app, don't be afraid to just delete it and redownload it from this page.
 - The App Manager, Checklist, Settings and File Creator and Editor apps all require the console to be run on Powershell (Windows) to save changes, so if you want to use them, then use the instructions below to run the console using Powershell.
 - You will need to download the source programs and App Manager manually, as they will not be included in the App Manager. All other apps, however, can be downloaded using the App Manager.
 - Don't run any of the apps separately, as they will not do anything. However, if you run the Checklist app, it will reset, so do not do this unless you want a quick way to reset it.

### Running AarOS on Windows Powershell:

 1. First, open up the start menu, search for "powershell" and run it.
 2. After this, head to the folder with the AarOS file in it, right-click on the folder, and click "Copy as path".
 3. Then, go back to Powershell, and type "cd", followed by a space and the copied path (press "Ctrl-V" to paste), and press Enter.
 4. Finally, type "./AarOS.py" and press Enter to run the console.

Note: Next time you want to use Powershell, you can use the up and down arrow keys to select previously run commands, which is faster if you haven't put in any commands after running the console.
